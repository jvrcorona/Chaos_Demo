# Chaos_Demo
Python code to demonstrate Chaos that was inspired by a numberphile youtube video found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbKtFN71Lfs
Currently the code only uses three points but I plan on adding any number of points and also adding a timelapse animation to show the 
progression of the simulation
